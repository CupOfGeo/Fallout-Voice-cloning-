# Fallout-Voice-cloning-
Going to play around with TalkNet and HiFi-Gan to clone some voice from Fallout NV 

So far we just make Datasets for 
Mr.New Vegas - This dataset is built stright from the wiki https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radio_New_Vegas

Mr.House - Audio comes from https://www.sounds-resource.com/download/5645/ and is matched up to the wikis transcriptions https://fallout-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_House%27s_dialogue with the removal of any extra sounds in curly brackets.
